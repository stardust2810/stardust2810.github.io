Delivery managers are responsible for leading a team that assists Product Managers with the setup and installation of technology tools and products. They work with stakeholders and end users to plan and configure systems, to develop solutions that will achieve needed objectives. They oversee the deployment of programs or systems, coordinating all of the parties involved to ensure a smooth process with minimal disruption. They may develop or supervise training programs to educate users, and also lead support and troubleshooting efforts.

A delivery manager guards the team’s time, to ensure continuous delivery is possible. Team time is precious time. They are concerned with enabling that team to deliver value, and do this by creating the right environment for the team to succeed, helping the team to self organise and creating a culture of learning and transparency.

The role is a one of a servant leader, they keep pace with the introduction of relevant agile / lean tools and techniques, and remove obstacles and blockers that might get in the way of delivery. They work closely with the product manager (sometimes known as product owner), but while the product manager is concerned with the vision the delivery manager is concerned with making it happen.

The main responsibilities of this role are:

* Deliver projects and products using the appropriate agile project management methodology, learning & iterating frequently
* Work with the Product Manager to define the roadmap for any given product and translate this into user stories
* Lead the collaborative, dynamic planning process – prioritising the work that needs to be done against the capacity and capability of the team
* Matrix-managing a multidisciplinary team
* Ensure all products are built to an appropriate level of quality for the stage (alpha/beta/production)
* Actively participating in the Delivery Manager community, sharing and re-applying skills and knowledge and bringing in best practice.
