The family had decided to spend our SGVoucher on a river cruise and had gone to Nando's at Plaza Singapura for our dinner on 31st Dec. While waiting for a seat at Nando's, Victoria's attention was had by the store opposite, Choco Express. She loves art and craft, and requested if we can get her a box of Kracie Popping Cooking Fun Festival. As she was quite a sensible and well-behaved gal recently, we acceded to her request. I had no idea what it was (expect that it came in powder form and you had to make something with it) but thought the illustrations on the box looked kinda cute.

Victoria could not wait to get started and the next day, she finally got the chance to do so. It was supposed to be a secret dessert for our lunch and she "chased" everyone out of her room and locked herself inside for a good half an hour. In her own infectious, chirpy and cheerful way, she got the entire family (including Emanuel) curious about what she had prepared for us.

We gathered in her room after lunch, and were pleasantly surprised when she presented us her masterpiece, a tantalising, miniaturised plate consisting of lollipops, baked corn, french fries, ice-cream and popsicles! Full points for presentation! Firstly, we sample her "fries" and ... it tasted like pineapple (both texture and taste), the type of fillings you get in pineapple tarts, pretty interesting!

Next to come was the "baked corns", which we all agreed tasted like the Hi-chew candies, not bad not bad. Third was the "chocolate ice-creams" which fell rather like bananas. And lastly, the popsicles! It tasted rather like apple and i didn't quite enjoy this as much as the "french fries" tho.

It was a pretty interesting experience for the entire family, and at $6.50 a box, it wasn't exactly what i considered cheap for a pack of snacks. However, to see the twinkle in Victoria's eyes, it was worth every single cent and much more. Here's looking to the next set of "desserts" from Chef Victoria!
