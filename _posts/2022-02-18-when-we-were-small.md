_"He said this when they were few in number, a tiny group of strangers in Canaan", Psalms 105, 12_

It has always been my desire to join GDS since i first heard of them, but i was unsure of myself and my expertise as a developer. The chance came near the end of 2020, when the team that i was seconded to as made redundant as the agency decided that they would like to build up their own in-house expertise instead.

Although i was very hesitant still, i did not want to have regrets and grabbed the opportunity when the door opened to me. Thus began my journey into GDS as a delivery manager (I had absolutely no idea what a delivery manager does, nor feel that my technical knowledge was adequate when compated to people who live and breathe it daily).
I joined Workpal first as a BA (pending conversion) and count myself lucky to meet my current RO (Jeanette). She didn't rush me into the DM role and gave me opprtunities to learn. However, "honey moons" cannot be expected to last forever, and thus I was pushed into the DM role officially, when the DM whom i was attached to in FileSG decided to pursue his dreams somewhere else (good for him!)

I still feel that I am not ready (but who could ever be?) and that amongst all the DMs, I am the one with the least experience and necessary expertise. Then in CG, I came across Psalms 105 verse 11 - 12, _"I will give you the land of Canaan as your special possession.‚Äù He said this when they were few in number, a tiny group of strangers in Canaan._
This verse speaks to me in my current situation, that God is tell me that I am already in my promised land, and that it is already mine to claim even tho my beginnings might be small and insignificant in the eyes of others.
As one pastor I came across on the internet said, do not despise the small beginnings.
