<p>Finally, our long awaited holiday is here! As we still could not travel overseas generally, we opted for a cruisecation on the World Dream! We were deciding between Royal Caribbean ( 4 days 3 nights, with kids below 12 traveling for free, a "last" chance for Victoria to enjoy this offer!) or Dream Cruises (3 days 2 nights), and finally settled on Dream Cruises. Reason? For the same price, we could get ourselves 2 rooms on Dream Cruises (they seem to go by head count) while we had to pay additional for the same on Royal Caribbean (by headcount AND room). In the weeks leading till the departure date, we prepared ourselves by watching reviews of the cruise from various people on youtube. Amongst the tips that we gotten, were
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive around 12noon for checking in</li>
<li>Book slots for pool / jacuzzi first</li>
<li>Download and use the app for booking of shows</li>
<li>Lunch is available!</li>
</ul>

Although Emanuel found out that we could park our car there for around $45, we decided to take the MRT there instead. We left home around 10ish and arrived at Marine South Pier station (neaarest station with about 10 mins walk to the Singapore Cruise Centre) around 11:40am. Recommended!

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/20211201-dream-cruise-3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>This being the COVID-19 period, all passengers had to take an ART test prior to boarding. Surprisingly, although Justina and Victoria took their test before us, Emanuel and I got out test results within 10 mins (sms received by me, or you can also check your TraceTogether app for the results.) earlier than Justina and Victoria. Once all the results were received, we were able to proceed from the ART holding center to join the queue for entry into the Singapore Cruise Centre.</p>

<p>The wait here was much longer, about 40 mins, before we even got into the cruise centre itself! Once inside however, it was relatively smooth (not sure whether it was due to the being out of the sweltering heat), from the mandatory checking of luggages to the receiving of our ship pass and the Tracy token (mandatory for moving around the ship). From then on, it was another wait (this time, at the departure hall) before we finally got on board our home for the next 2 nights, the Genting World Dream, around 2:15pm. Now our holiday is starting proper!</p>

<p>Once aboard the ship, we sprung into action immediately! Victoria and I were responsible for booking slots for the pool and jacuzzi whilst Justina and Emanuel took our luggages to the room. Surprisingly, when Victoria and I reached the pool, there was but only 3 others in front of us. We practically got a free selection of any slots we wanted, the only caveat being that one could only either book for the pool, or the jaccuzi, abit of a bummer. Nonetheless, we decided upon the 7pm slot for jacuzzi instead.<span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/20211201-dream-cruise-4.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>Once that was settled, we went back to the cabins, to find both Justina and Emanuel nicely settled down. We proceeded for lunch at the chinese restaurant (the kids were protesting as the reviews rated the food there as mediocre) but we were pleasantly surprised by the soup and the dessert. Even Victoria (the loudest "protester") was won over. We decided to explore the ship after lunch, and made our way to the upper decks with the intention to book a slot for the rope course (which Victoria had stated in no uncertain terms is an activity that she MUST do). Little did we expect that we were the first in the queue (10 mins prior to opening)! Justina and Emanuel played the mini-golf and table tennis, while Victoria and I went for the rope course and the rock climbing, activities that took up the rest of the afternoon. Initially, we were disappointed that the zip link (part of the rope course) was not open but on hindsight, it was a blessing in disguised as we went thro all the available obstacles in the rope course, something that cannot be done if the zip line was available.<span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/20211201-dream-cruise-5.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></p>
