<p>Finally, our long awaited holiday is here! As we still could not travel overseas generally, we opted for a cruisecation on the World Dream! We had prepared ourselves by watching reviews of the cruise from various people on youtube. Amongst the tips that we gotten, were
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive around 12noon for checking in</li>
<li>Book slots for pool / jacuzzi first</li>
<li>Download and use the app for booking of shows</li>
<li>Lunch is available!</li>
</ul>

Although Emanuel found out that we could park our car there for around $45, we decided to take the MRT there instead. We left home around 10ish and arrived at Marine South Pier station (neaarest station with about 10 mins walk to the Singapore Cruise Centre) around 11:40am. Recommended!

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/20211201-dream-cruise-3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>This being the COVID-19 period, all passengers had to take an ART test prior to boarding. Surprisingly, although Justina and Victoria took their test before us, Emanuel and I got out test results within 10 mins (sms received by me, or you can also check your TraceTogether app for the results.) earlier than Justina and Victoria. Once all the results were received, we were able to proceed from the ART holding center to join the queue for entry into the Singapore Cruise Centre. The wait here was much longer, about 40 mins, before we even got into the cruise centre itself! Once inside however, it was relatively smooth (not sure whether it was due to the being out of the sweltering heat), from the mandatory checking of luggages to the receiving of our ship pass and the Tracy token (mandatory for moving around the ship). From then on, it was another wait (this time, at the departure hall) before we finally got on board our home for the next 2 nights, the Genting World Dream, around 2:15pm. Now our holiday is starting proper!</p>
